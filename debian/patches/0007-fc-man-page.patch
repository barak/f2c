+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+.B fc 
+is a script intended to be used as a front end to the 
+.B f2c
+FORTRAN-to-C translator. It is supposed to make the whole 
+.B f2c 
+and C compiler setup look like a real Fortran compiler.
+
+File arguments with a 
+.B .f 
+suffix are compiled as Fortran source.
+Files with a 
+.B .F 
+suffix are passed through the C preprocessor
+.B cpp(1)
+first. Files with 
+.B .c 
+(C source) or 
+.B .s 
+(assembly source)
+suffixes are passed to the C compiler directly.
+Files with a 
+.B .e 
+suffix are treated as efl source files, and
+files with a
+.B .r
+suffix are treated as RATFOR source files.
+
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP 8
+.I \-o objfile
+Produce an output executable named
+.I objfile
+rather than using the default name a.out.
+.TP 8
+.I \-c
+Do not call the linker; instead, leave relocatable object files
+as *.o.
+.TP 8
+.I \-S
+Produce assembly output as file.s
+.TP 8
+.I \-C
+Compile in extra code to check that array subscripts are in bounds.
+.TP 8
+.I \-l library
+Libraries specified with this option are passed to the linker.
+.TP 8
+.I \-U def
+Definitions specified with this option are passed to C compiler (for .c files)
+or to cpp (for .F files) to remove definition.
+.TP 8
+.I \-u
+Complain about undeclared variables.
+.TP 8
+.I \-v, \-\-version
+Print version of f2c in use
+.TP 8
+.I \-w
+Omit all warning messages.
+.TP 8
+.I \-w66
+Omit Fortran 66 (Fortran IV) compatibility warning messages.
+.TP 8
+.I \-D switch
+The given switch is passed to the C compiler (for .c files), to cpp 
+(for .F files) and to f2c.
+.TP 8
+.I \-I includepath
+Passed to the C compiler (for .c files), to cpp (for .F files)
+and to f2c.
+.TP 8
+.I \-Ntnnn
+Allow nnn entries in table t.
+.TP 8
+.I \-P
+Emit .P files.
+.SH BUGS
+.B fc
+isn't really very good -- try fort77 (1), which does a better job.
+.br
+This manual page isn't really very good either...
+.SH AUTHOR
+S. Feldman, D. Gay, M. Maimone, N, Schryer are all mentioned
+in the paper on the conversion of Fortran to C.
+.br
+Peter Maydell (pmaydell@chiark.greenend.org.uk) wrote this manual page,
+and Alan Bain (alanb@chiark.greenend.org.uk) made some minor
+modifications.
